        <!--Provide an overview of the general topic or question of interest
        (e.g., "what is meant by 'homelessness' and why is it a particular
        problem in Seattle?").-->

        Students at UW are provided with many opportunities to connect and meet
        like-minded students, whether it be through classes or RSOs. What's
        missing is a digital platform to find like-minded people beyond the means
        of working on group projects or meeting at club events! This is why we came up
        with UW Study Buddy, an academic social media platform meant to make...

        <h2>Problem Background</h2>
        <p>Identify at least 1 previous or existing attempt to solve this problem (e.g., "what other web apps attempt
            to address homelessness? What has already been tried?")</p>

                <strong>Studdy:</strong> Studdy is a networking app designed for students to match with their peers
                and provide a platform to give and receive help with their schoolwork while meeting new people and
                making friends. It was created during the Covid from the lack of interaction witnessed between
                students through virtual classes. Setbacks: this app works globally and is not specific towards a certain 
                campus, thus, it is unlikely to find lasting group of friends.
