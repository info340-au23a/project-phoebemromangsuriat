        <!--Provide an overview of the general topic or question of interest
        (e.g., "what is meant by 'homelessness' and why is it a particular
        problem in Seattle?").-->

        Students at UW are provided with many opportunities to connect and meet
        like-minded students, whether it be through classes or RSOs. What's
        missing is a digital platform to find like-minded people beyond the means
        of working on group projects or meeting at club events! This is why we came up
        with UW Study Buddy, an academic social media platform meant to make...

        <h2>Problem Background</h2>

        <p>Identify an information technology problem in that space (e.g., 
            "what information problems related to homelessness are unaddressed?").</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Studying by proximity:</strong> One example of an information technology pain point that 
                has gone relatively unaddressed in this space is creating opportunities for students on the same
                college campus or educational institution to form study groups, as many existing websites are not 
                catered toward students who want to create local groups.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Optimizing matching algorithms:</strong> While there are some existing (albiet outdated)
                sites that help students find groups for startups or projects, most of these sites are not accomodating
                for individuals who are hoping to find friends and make deeper connections while furthering academics. 
                Existing matching algorithms are not comprehensize enough to achieve this.

            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Platforms not being subject-specific:</strong> Many students are seeking for connections with 
                people who are pursuing a similar academic path. Existing platforms are not built to include the different 
                courses within specific institutions, which hinders the ability of students to find a population who are working
                on the same assignments. By including a school's specific courses in a website's functionality, students will be 
                able to find students in their same subject much more efficiently. 
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Identify at least 1 previous or existing attempt to solve this problem (e.g., "what other web apps attempt
            to address homelessness? What has already been tried?")</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Studdy:</strong> Studdy is a networking app designed for students to match with their peers
                and provide a platform to give and receive help with their schoolwork while meeting new people and
                making friends. It was created during the Covid from the lack of interaction witnessed between
                students through virtual classes. Setbacks: this app works globally and is not specific towards a certain 
                campus, thus, it is unlikely to find lasting group of friends.
