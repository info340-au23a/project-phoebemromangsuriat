        <!--Provide an overview of the general topic or question of interest
        (e.g., "what is meant by 'homelessness' and why is it a particular
        problem in Seattle?").-->

        Students at UW are provided with many opportunities to connect and meet
        like-minded students, whether it be through classes or RSOs. What's
        missing is a digital platform to find like-minded people beyond the means
        of working on group projects or meeting at club events! This is why we came up
        with UW Study Buddy, an academic social media platform meant to making finding
        study groups, making friends in your major, and seeking academic advice or supplies
        easier!
